**MCP Agent** is a dynamic AI integration tool that can **discover, download, and connect** to any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Once connected, the agent can inspect all available tools, prompts, and resources, execute them autonomously, and seamlessly switch between multiple MCP servers.

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

- **Autonomous MCP Server Discovery & Connection**  
  The agent can identify MCP servers listed on GitHub, clone them locally, and install necessary dependencies.

- **Self-Directed Interaction with MCP Tools**  
  Reads and executes any available tools and resources provided by the connected MCP server, without requiring manual intervention.

- **Multi-Server Navigation**  
  Connects and disconnects from multiple MCP servers on-demand, giving agent the ability to utilize various capabilities across different environments.
